# Frontend-Developer-Challenge
The task is to build a Repository Search application with the Github Developer API v3. It can
be broken down into three sub-tasks:

# 1. Repository Search by Name

The application should have an input field that allows the user to search for a
repository. The search results should be displayed in a list in the UI.
Each result should be displayed in a card which has the full name of the repository,
the programming language, the repository description, a link to the repository, the
number of stars and the number of open issues in the repository. The UI should show
only the 6 most relevant results for a given search criteria.

# 2. Top Contributors Page

Inside each repository card, there should be a link to Top Contributors Page that
when clicked, navigates to a new page that displays the top 10 contributors for that
repository.
The contributor info should be displayed in a card that has Github username of the
contributor, their Github avatar, a link to the their Github profile, and the number of
contributions.

# 3. Pagination

The list of contributors should have a Fetch More button at the end. When the user
clicks on Fetch More, he should be able to see 5 more contributors in addition to the
already displayed contributors.
The application should be written using React, and you are free to use any other tool or
framework of your choice. The app should contain some basic styling, i.e. the content should
be readable, evenly spaced and properly aligned, but building a flawless UI is not the main
objective of this task. You will find below some wireframes of what the UI could possibly look
like, but this is just an indication and you have complete freedom to change it.
The goal is to write a properly structured application with reusable code that respects
Javascript development guidelines. Documentation of any library that might be needed may
be referred.
Please make your solution available via Github/Gitlab, with clear instructions to install and
run it. We are also also interested in your commit history, so make sure to include it! We look
forward to receiving your solution.
